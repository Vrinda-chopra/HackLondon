# Smart Assess

As a teaching assistant or examiner, it can be quite tedious to manually grade exams and then evaluate their score.

Smart Assess is a Streamlit application designed to grade assignments by comparing student submissions against given rubrics. This application leverages the `vectorshift.ai` API to evaluate answers based on the criteria specified in the rubrics document.

Built using OpenAI's GPT 4, Vectorshift AI and Streamlit

## Features

- Upload PDF documents for rubrics, questions, and student answers.
- Enter specific questions for more directed grading insights.
